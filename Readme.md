# TYPO3 Extension ``md_newsfrontend``

This extension enables a frontend user to add ``ext:news``-records in the frontend. Templates are ready to use with the bootstrap framework and icons will be shown, if you have included the Font Awesome icon set in your project.

## Requirements

- TYPO3 >= 8.7
- ext:news >= 6.0

## Installation

- Install the extension by using the extension manager or use composer
- Include the static TypoScript of the extension
- Configure the extension by setting your own constants

## Usage

Add the plugin to a page, which is restricted by the frontend user login. After you have inserted the plugin, frontend users are able to add, edit and delete news records.
